high-dimensional longitudinal omics data

This project involves high-dimensional longitudinal omics data. The manuscript stored and worked on here contains the current state-of-affairs on how to analyze such data multivariately. With the particular aim in mind to reconstruct the changes in the conditional dependence graph that occur of the course of the longitudinal study.
